`#` indicate obstacles
`.` : empty space
`S` : starting position
`G` : ending (Goal) position
`=` : path followed

So giving the maze "maze1.txt" below as input:</br>

```
S#####
......
#.#.#.
#.#.#.
...#.G
##...#
```

Would output this:

```
S#####
======
#.#.#=
#.#.#=
...#.G
##...#
```

where `=` are parts of the resulting path that was taken.
